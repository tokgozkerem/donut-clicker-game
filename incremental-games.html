        <h1>What Is an Incremental Game?</h1>
        <p>
          Incremental games are built on compounding progression. Instead of only
          increasing one number, each decision should increase the speed of future
          growth. The best games create a loop where upgrades, multipliers, and resets
          all connect into one long-term system.

        <h2>The Core Loop of Incremental Games</h2>
        <p>
          Most incremental games follow a familiar loop: generate resources, buy
          stronger production tools, unlock new multipliers, then repeat. The key is
          that every cycle should make the next cycle faster.
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Resource generation starts small and scales with upgrades.</li>
          <li>Efficiency decisions become more important over time.</li>
          <li>Compounding creates exponential growth when systems align.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Linear Growth</h3>
            <p>
              You gain a fixed amount each cycle. It feels steady but eventually slows
              against increasing costs.

            <h3>Exponential Growth</h3>
            <p>
              Multipliers increase both current and future gains. This is the core
              reason incremental games feel satisfying over long runs.

          A good strategy is to chase upgrades that improve your future curve, not just
          your current snapshot.

        <h2>Prestige: Why Resetting Can Be Optimal</h2>
        <p>
          Prestige systems are central to most incremental game design. Resetting can
          feel counterintuitive, but it converts stalled progress into permanent power.
          The right reset timing can save hours across future runs.
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Reset too early: weak permanent gain, low efficiency.</li>
          <li>Reset too late: time loss in a saturated run.</li>
          <li>Best timing: when next-run acceleration beats current-run waiting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Incremental Strategy Checklist</h2>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Track output per second, not only total resources.</li>
          <li>Compare upgrades by impact-to-cost ratio.</li>
          <li>Protect momentum by avoiding low-impact expensive buys.</li>
          <li>Plan your reset window before progression fully stalls.</li>
          <li>Adjust route after each prestige cycle.</li>

        <h2>Incremental Game FAQ</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Are incremental and idle games the same thing?</summary>
          <p>
            They overlap but are not identical. Idle describes automation behavior,
            while incremental describes compounding progression structure.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do incremental games require complex math?</summary>
          <p>
            Not strictly. Basic comparison of upgrade impact and timing is usually
            enough to improve runs significantly.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can beginners enjoy incremental games?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Good titles introduce systems gradually, so players can learn strategy
            step by step.
