        <h1>What Is a Clicker Game?</h1>
        <p>
          A clicker game starts with direct interaction: you click, tap, or trigger an
          action to generate resources. As progression opens, the game shifts from
          manual input to strategic management. This mix of action + optimization is
          why clicker games remain popular across browser and mobile platforms.

            <h3>Active Layer</h3>
            <p>
              Immediate player actions create early momentum and unlock the first
              strategic options.

            <h3>Automation Layer</h3>
            <p>
              Upgrades reduce dependency on constant input and let progression continue
              between actions.

          The best clicker games blend both layers so players get quick feedback and
          long-term depth at the same time.

        <h2>Clicker vs Idle vs Incremental</h2>
        <ul class="term-list">
          <li><strong>Clicker:</strong> Focus on direct repeated actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Idle:</strong> Focus on automatic progression over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Incremental:</strong> Focus on compounding long-term growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In practice, most successful modern titles combine all three. That is why
          players often search for these terms together.

        <h2>Upgrade Strategy for Faster Progress</h2>
        <p>
          Better runs come from better purchase order. Do not buy only what looks big;
          buy what improves the growth curve.
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Prioritize upgrades with strong production-to-cost efficiency.</li>
          <li>Unlock automation before manual clicking becomes low-impact.</li>
          <li>Use multipliers to amplify existing production layers.</li>
          <li>Re-evaluate route after major unlocks or resets.</li>

        <h2>Clicker Game FAQ</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Are clicker games beginner-friendly?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Most clicker games start with simple mechanics and gradually introduce
            deeper systems like automation and prestige.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I need to play constantly to improve?</summary>
          <p>
            Not always. Many clicker games include idle components that continue
            progression between active sessions.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is strategy really important in clicker games?</summary>
          <p>
            Definitely. Efficient upgrade timing and reset decisions often matter more
            than raw click speed in mid and late game.
          </p>
