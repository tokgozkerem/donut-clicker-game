        <h1>What Is an Idle Clicker Game?</h1>
        <p>
          An idle clicker game is a progression game where active actions and passive
          systems work together. You start by clicking to generate resources, then use
          upgrades to automate production. The main objective is not only to gain more,
          but to increase the speed of future gains.

        <h2>Core Mechanics of Idle Clicker Games</h2>
        <p>
          Most idle clicker games are built around four connected systems. Understanding
          these systems is the fastest way to improve as a player.
        </p>
        <div class="grid-2">
          <article class="card">
            <h3>1. Active Income</h3>
            <p>
              Early game progress usually comes from manual input. This creates the
              first resources and unlocks the first set of upgrades.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>2. Passive Income</h3>
            <p>
              Idle systems generate resources automatically. A good idle game transitions
              from action-heavy to automation-heavy over time.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>3. Multipliers</h3>
            <p>
              Multipliers amplify production and create compounding growth. This is where
              progression can shift from linear to exponential.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article class="card">
            <h3>4. Reset Loops</h3>
            <p>
              Prestige or soft reset systems trade short-term loss for permanent bonuses,
              making future runs faster and more strategic.

        <h2>How Progression Works</h2>
        <p>
          In a quality idle clicker game, each upgrade affects the value of future
          upgrades. That is why timing matters. If you buy a low-impact upgrade at the
          wrong moment, you slow your curve. If you buy a high-impact upgrade early,
          your entire run accelerates.
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Early phase: build baseline income quickly.</li>
          <li>Middle phase: prioritize automation and multiplier synergy.</li>
          <li>Late phase: optimize reset timing and long-run efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="block">
        <h2>Beginner Strategy That Actually Helps</h2>
        <p>
          Many players lose time by buying the most expensive visible option. A better
          approach is to compare impact per cost and choose upgrades that improve
          production rate, not just current totals.
        </p>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Buy upgrades that increase per-second output first.</li>
          <li>Do not delay automation if it has better long-run value.</li>
          <li>Use reset mechanics when progress clearly plateaus.</li>
          <li>Treat every run as feedback for a better next run.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes in Idle Clicker Games</h2>
        <ul class="clean-list">
          <li>Over-investing in one branch and ignoring balanced growth.</li>
          <li>Waiting too long to use prestige or reset systems.</li>
          <li>Choosing upgrades by price instead of production impact.</li>
          <li>Ignoring passive systems during mid-game progression.</li>

        <h2>Idle Clicker Games FAQ</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Do idle clicker games require constant playing?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Strong idle games are designed so passive systems continue growth while
            you are not actively interacting every second.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Are idle clicker games skill-based?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. The main skill is decision quality: upgrade order, reset timing,
            and resource allocation.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can one game be both idle and incremental?</summary>
          <p>
            Absolutely. Most modern titles combine idle automation with incremental
            progression loops and clicker input.
